How to test

    Make sure mysql and mysql server are indeed installed and that they are the correct versions:

    # rpm -qa | grep mysql && chkconfig --list | grep mysql
    mysql-5.0.27-1.fc6
    mysql-5.0.27-1.fc6
    mysql-gui-common-1.1.10-3.fc6
    mysql-server-5.0.27-1.fc6
    mysql-administrator-1.1.10-3.fc6
    mysqld          0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off

    Starting mysqld on boot:

    # chkconfig --level 2345 mysqld on && service mysqld restart && chkconfig --list | grep mysqld
    Stopping MySQL:                                            [  OK  ]
    Starting MySQL:                                            [  OK  ]
    mysqld          0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off

    Clear MySQL scrollback history (so sensitive data such as passwords cannot be seen by others with access):

    ]# cat /dev/null > ~/.mysql_history

    Show all users in the MySQL Server database:

    mysql> select * from mysql.user;
    8 rows in set (0.00 sec)

    Delete a user from the MySQL Server database:

    mysql> delete from mysql.user where host = "dev.mydomain.com";Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    Delete a null user (user without a username) from the MySQL Server database:

    mysql> delete from mysql.user where user = ' ';
    Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.00 sec)
